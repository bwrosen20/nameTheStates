Remember that Friends episode where they have to name all 50 states in 10 minutes?
I made it a little easier.

Upon opening the app, you'll see start button. Simply click the button and the game starts.

The game will begin and you have 10 minutes to name all 50 states. 
As you enter in all your states, the grid will fill up.

Once the 10-minute timer runs out, you'll be either told of which states you missed or if you get them all you'll be sent to the victory screen.
